# jboss-developer-site

## Getting Started
This section covers the steps you need to do in order to setup your environment and get the site running for the first time. Further sections cover the details.

_NOTE:_ You must use a version of Ruby installed via RVM.

Install RVM from here http://rvm.io and then install the correct Ruby version (See [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22605921/fresh-installs-of-rvm-and-ruby-2-1-1-dyld-library-pathing-error) for details on why '--disable-binary' is needed):

    rvm install ruby-2.1.1 --disable-binary

Now checkout and build the site:

    git clone git@github.com:jboss-developer/www.jboss.org.git
    cd www.jboss.org
    rake setup
    rake update
    export vimeo_access_token_secret=<Contact someone on the JBoss Developer team for this>
    export vimeo_client_secret=<Contact someone on the JBoss Developer team for this>
    rake clean preview

_NOTE_ The site will take a long time to build for the first time (10 minutes+). Subsequent builds are much quicker.

If the build was successful, you should be able to visit the site here: [http://localhost:4242](http://localhost:4242)


## Development

If you are working on the CSS, make sure to also run `compass watch`

New pages should be added to the root with the extension `.html.slim`

### Updating the DCP

Updates to the DCP should happen automatically if the build is being done on the build server, however, if
it is down or there is another emergency situation and the site needs to be built and content pushed to the
DCP for staging or production please contact Pete Muir, Jason Porter, Andrew Rubinger or Ray Ploski. Below
are steps to setup the environment for pushing content to the DCP.

In order to update content in the DCP you must have the URL set in config.yaml and the following two environment variables set: 

    export dcp_user=jboss-developer
    export dcp_password=<see one of the people above for this>

If these two variables are not set you will see a warning during the build:

    Missing username and / or password for searchisko

You can then preview the staging site, which will also push data to the DCP staging server:

    rake preview[staging]
    
Alterntively, you can preview/deploy to staging or production and the asociated DCP server will also be updated.

## Deployment

Run `rake deploy[staging]` or `rake deploy[production]`

To tag:

`rake deploy[staging,tagname]`

To run in Awestruct in development mode, execute:

`rake`

To run Awestruct while developing, execute:

`rake preview`

To clean the generated site before you build, execute:

`rake clean preview`

To deploy using the production profile, execute:

`rake deploy`

To get a list of all tasks, execute:

`rake -T`

Now you're Awestruct with rake!
